# A python module for nonlinear moving horizon estimation

This module implements the moving hozion estimation algorithm as described in the author's book:

Nonlinear Control of Uncertain Systems:** Conventional and Learning-Based alternatives with python by *Mazen Alamir*, Springer-Nature, 2025.

Moving horizon estimation is based on on-line nonlinear programming solution over moving windows. The principle is to reconciliate the gathered measurements with some known although potentially partially known dynamics of the system being *observed*.
